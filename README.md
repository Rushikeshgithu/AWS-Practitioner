## 📌 About This Repository  

This repository documents my **AWS re/Start** learning journey, aimed at preparing for the **AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner** exam.  
I am currently enrolled in the AWS re/Start program with **Hope Foundation**, gaining hands-on experience in AWS cloud concepts, services, and best practices.  

I will be uploading **structured notes, labs, and topic-wise study materials** as I progress. This serves as both my personal learning record and a resource for others starting their AWS journey.
